# Micronaire

RAG pipelines enable developers to augment their chat experiences with informational documents that their agents can leverage to provide better answers. Evaluating these pipelines is a new area of study, with solutions like [RAGChecker](https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker) and [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) being state of the art frameworks that are implemented in Python. This project aims to take these ideas and bring them to DotNet through Semantic Kernel.

Micronaire brings actionable metrics to RAG pipeline evaluation by taking a set of ground truth questions and answers as well as a RAG pipeline, evaluating the pipeline against the ground truth using our metrics (see below), and then producing an evaluation report.

## Packaging

Before packaging, ensure that the version of the package has been bumped according to [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). This can be automated in the future.

To package the project, run the following command:

```powershell
dotnet pack .\src\Micronaire\Micronaire.csproj
```

This will generate a NuGet package in the `bin` directory. This package can then be uploaded to [NuGet](nuget.org)!

The package page is [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Micronaire).

In the future, this will be automated through a GitHub action.
