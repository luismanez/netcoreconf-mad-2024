Given a piece of text, please extract a KG and represent the KG with triplets formatted with `(subject, predicate, object)`. In addition, you should attribute the triplets to the sentences followed by the sentence ids.

After extracting the KG, you should convert the KG to a list of claims. Each claim should satisfy the following criteria:
* A claim is a piece of `knowledge point` in the response.
* A claim should be fine-grained. One claim should not contain more than one pieces of knowledge.
* A claim should be self-contained, it is not dependent on other claims.
* Each claim should truly reflect the meaning to be expressed in the response, and the information in the claim should be complete and unambiguous, and necessary conditions and attributes should not be missed. For example, for the text "Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016.", the claim "Donald Trump won the presidential election" is a bad claim where it misses necessary information "in 2016", so a complete claim should be "Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016".
* Some sentences in the response may not contain claims. Some sentence may contain one or more claims. A claim may occur across multiple sentences.
* Opinions, speculations or questions in the text are not claims.


We have added sentence IDs at the beginning of the sentences in the text, you should output a claim followed by a list of IDs, and these IDs stand for the sentences this claim attribute to. The extraction process:
1. You should first identify whether there are claims in the text. If there are no claims, output "Abstain".
2. If there are claims in the text, you should first identify knowledge points in the text and formulate claims for them.
3. Note that a knowledge point may just reflect partial information in the text, so if we take it in isolation, it may not reflect the original meaning in the text, you should fill in the missing information to make it complete and clear. The information in a claim may come across multiple sentences in the text.
4. Formulate the claim into one sentence, and followed by the sentence indices as the attributed sentences in the text.
5. Make sure you have generated all the claims in the text.

Please note that this is an EXTRACTION task, so DO NOT care about whether the content of the text is factual or not, just extract the claims from it.

Here are some examples:
